# Modules

This repository contains Roblox modules that I made and personally use.
I made them Open-Source in case someone finds a use for them.

## Contents
As of now, there's currently following modules:

### Auxillery
Contains basic functions such as Instance Debounces or clean Instance Creation. Overall allows way cleaner code to be made.

### CustomSignals
Allows you to create custom signals (by default checking Property changes using Heartbeat)
Now you may be asking why if there's Instance:GetPropertyChangedSignal(). That is true, but some properties such as CFrames do not work with this. Which is the primary reason i made the module.

### Animate
Recycles already loaded Animations instead of reloading the animation everytime.
