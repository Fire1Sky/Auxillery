# Auxillery

This repository contains a bunch of modules I made and think you should use. Their uses vary a lot, as they are based on my needs. Although I'm sure a lot of people will find uses for these.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>You can read the documentation [here](https://github.com/Fire1Sky/Modules/blob/main/Documentation.md)

## Contents
I listed summarizations of every module here. For further explanation, check out the documentation.

### Auxillery
Contains basic functions such as Instance Debounces or clean Instance Creation. Overall allows way cleaner code to be made.

### CustomSignals
Allows you to create custom signals (by default checking Property changes using Heartbeat)

### Animate
Recycles already loaded Animations instead of reloading the animation everytime.
